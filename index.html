        Loved daughter, unmatched mother, incredible sister, devote wife, awesome chruch women's leader, and there are a thousand things more to say about her. For me is easy to describe her with just one word:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 10px; text-align: center; letter-spacing: 5px;">
        <q><b><i>Perfect</i></b></q>
      </p>
      <p>
        She lived to give her children the life she couldn't have, worked tirelessly for years, even when wasn't necessary, from
        her I learned, not only write or read, but work for that I really want, and never give up even against the whole world.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        With her, I learn how to keep myself on my way, with or without strength. I'm who I am because of her. And there's
        nothing I would change from her, 'cause, of course, she wasn't perfect, but without our mistakes, we aren't ourselves.
        That she taught me.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        There are a lot of things that I want to tell you, but, you always know what's in my head even before I say anything,
        but... I love you and miss you like I never mind.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        After all, I thank God. I still remember all those times when she used to say:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 10px; text-align: center;">
        <q>My prayer is that God let me raise my children, and, someday meet my grandchildren</q>
      </p>
      <p><br>
        I know that I'm going to see you again, so, thanks, thanks for all this you gave to me. I know I don't deserve this, but
        anyway, you mom, you are awesome.
      </p>
